Like most people I would describe my late teen / early adult years as turbulent which ultimately manifested as a "What's the point of all of this?" mentality which at the time felt unshakable.

Until through some well timed moments of clarity and for lack of a better term "growing up" I discovered that purpose was an incredibly powerful motivation that would push me to reap the most out of life. 

Luckily my two older brothers had unknowingly set me on this path all the way back in 1999 when they taught little seven year old me how to play Starcraft: Brood War(and of course Starcraft 2 in 2010). 

Starcraft as a franchise has been described has the ultimate game of self improvement. I would sum up it's 1v1 format as you and your opponent running parrallel trying your hardest to make as few mistakes as possible so that you don't fall behind. 
So to improve you must practice, you practice faster inputs, more purposeful decision making, and to stay calm under pressure to avoid catastrophic mistakes and through this undertaking you will discover a vase community dedicated to this insane ideal of self vs self. If I lose it's not the game's fault it's mine, I wasn't fast enough or I was too indecisive or my opponent was simply made less mistakes, so now I assess and improve and try again.

Fate would have it that one of close friends is an avid rock climber and one day I decided to tag along to a climbing gym just to see what it was all about and in doing so yet again I came across a group of people obsessed with the ideal of self vs self. 
If you can't top a boulder problem or you fall off a sport climbing route it's not the rock's fault it's yours. It's not you vs the rock is you vs you. 

And the key that made me so obsessed with both these activities was problem solving. 

In Starcraft you collect information to formulate a response that either reflects or cripples your opponent resulting in victory.
When you climb you "read" the boulder problem decide on a set of movements you feel are correct, link them into a sequence and execute attempting to complete the problem. 

I've been so enveloped by my hobbies that my career has been kind of left at the way side as a sort of means to an end but earlier this year with the right nudges from the right people I decided to take my career down the same path as the other manage aspects of my life, problem solving. 

So here we are, coding. 

Flatiron School and coding sort of fell into my lap while I was on the hunt for a way to make my hobbies into career and after some research once again I feel like I have discovered yet another community that is obsessed with their craft and how they themselves can improve through it. 

My whole life I had been writing loops in my head and physically executing them out in the wilderness somewhere without even knowing. 

Assess the problem, create a solution, and execute.
Did it fail?
Learn, improve, and try again. 

Coding was the right choice because it shares the most important trait with climbing and starcraft which is that the skill or knowledge ceiling is seemingly infinite and for some people the thought of that looming over them might be uncomfortable but for me it is the most exciting part of this endeavour.

There is always a harder climb, always a better player, and always another bug. 

Learn, Improve, and try again.
