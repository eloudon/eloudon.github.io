My Rails project Bouderbook is the digital equivalent of the physical bouldering/climbing guides that are still common practice in the UK and Europe. 

These guides are published every so oftern and they contain the name, grade and description of the boulder problems in a given area. 

BoulderBook allows users to establish a new climb giving it a name and grade they think is appropriate with an optional description, these registered climbs are on display for all and can be given a star rating by other climbers who have sent(climber slang for completed) the climb. 

These rating are averaged out and displayed next to each climb to enable sorting functionality and of course you can't un-climb a climb so each user can only mark each climb as "sent" once however if your feelings about that particular piece of rock change over of time (which trust me they do) users can edit their own ratings. 


This one might be for more of a niche group but check it out!
